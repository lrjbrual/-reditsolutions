              <p style="color:grey;" class= "rjay">
               I've started my career at the young age of 19 in Information Technology as system engineer working for a  telecommunication company.
             </p>
             <p style="color:grey;">
              After two years I had the chance to work for two major world wide companies, IBM and HP. I worked as Assistant Manager to a Project Lead of Data Center.
              I work there for about 2 years and decided it was time to change.  I resigned and build my own software development company with a focus in accounting system, and Online travel agency.
            </p>
            <p style="color:grey;">
             and Now I'm currently focusing on Software Web development and teaching as a professor in Graduate School University.
             <br>
             Thanks to my multiple degrees from bachelor in computer engineering to master degree in business administration and ICT Management & IT Governance, I have build up the necessary experience to face those kind of challenges now a days.
           </p>
           <p style="color:grey;">
            I'm confident that if you managed to do a little thing well, you can do a bigger thing well too.

            Young entrepreneur I started my career at 25 years old.
            I deeply believe that the web has transformed our world and will keep on transforming it in the future in a way that we don’t even imagine.</p>
            <p style="color:grey">Therefore a few months ago I decided to learn how to code.
              I wanted to know, to understand what was behind the scene.
              After a lot of reading and an intensive training in the beautiful city of Amsterdam I’ve acquired the necessary skills to prototype any web platform.</p>
